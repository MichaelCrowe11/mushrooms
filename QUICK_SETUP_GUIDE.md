# ðŸ”§ Quick Setup for BigCommerce Preview

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Action Items**

Since the Stencil CLI authentication has expired (403 error), here are the immediate steps to continue with the project:

### **Option 1: BigCommerce Admin Preview (Recommended)**
1. **Log into BigCommerce Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to **Storefront** â†’ **Themes**
   - Find **"Southwest Mushrooms v1.0.0"** in the theme library
   - Click **"Preview"** to test the integrated theme

2. **Test New Features**
   - Visit `/videos` page for YouTube gallery
   - Visit `/gpt-lab` page for AI assistant integration  
   - Visit `/apps` page for apps hub
   - Test mobile responsiveness and glass-morphism effects

### **Option 2: Re-authenticate Stencil CLI**
If you need local development access:

```bash
# Navigate to theme directory
cd /workspaces/mushrooms

# Re-initialize Stencil CLI with fresh credentials
stencil init

# Enter when prompted:
# - Store URL (e.g., https://your-store.mybigcommerce.com)
# - API Access Token
# - Client ID
# - Client Secret (optional)

# Start local development server
stencil start
```

**Note**: You'll need BigCommerce API credentials from the store admin.
